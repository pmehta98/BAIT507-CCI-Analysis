## üìå Overview

This repository contains the work for **BAIT 507 Homework Assignment 2**, focusing on **data ethics and SQL query analysis** in the context of Consumer Carbon Incentives (CCI) programs. The project is aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, specifically:

- **Goal 12:** Responsible Consumption and Production
- **Goal 13:** Climate Action

The database explored in this assignment holds records about CCI programs, simulating real-world data on consumer behavior and rewards for low-carbon choices.

## üéØ Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is threefold:

1. **Explore Data Ethics Issues**
   - Analyze biases in reward systems
   - Examine unintended consequences
   - Consider impact across different demographics (age, economic status, geography)

2. **Analyze Database Records Using SQL**
   - Consumer behavior patterns
   - Environmental sustainability metrics
   - Reward program effectiveness
   - User engagement trends

3. **Provide Actionable Recommendations**
   - Improvements for CCI program design
   - Strategies to address identified biases
   - Enhanced sustainability outcomes

---

## ‚ú® Features

### Data Ethics Analysis
- **Bias Detection:** Address questions about biases in the CCI program
  - Age-based disparities
  - Economic status considerations
  - Geographic accessibility
- **Unintended Consequences:** Examine potential increases in carbon emissions due to certain reward mechanisms
- **Fairness Assessment:** Evaluate equity in reward distribution

### SQL Query Solutions
- **User Participation Trends:** Identify patterns in program engagement
- **Credit Balance Calculations:** Track user rewards and incentives
- **Activity Rankings:** Analyze popularity of different low-carbon activities
- **Temporal Analysis:** Examine changes in behavior over time
- **Demographic Analysis:** Compare participation across user segments

---

## üìÅ Key Components

### 1. Database Schema (`CCI_DDL.sql`)

**Description:** Database schema and initial data population

**Key Tables:**
- `ACTIVITY` - Low-carbon activities users can engage in
- `CARBONREWARD` - Reward structure for different activities
- `CCIUSER` - User demographics and registration information
- `PARTICIPATION` - Records of user engagement in activities
- `CREDITS` - User reward balances and transactions

### 2. SQL Queries (`Queries.sql`)

**Description:** SQL scripts solving assigned analytical questions

**Query Topics:**
- User participation statistics
- Credit balance calculations
- Activity popularity rankings
- Temporal trend analysis
- Demographic comparisons

### 3. Data Ethics Analysis (`Data Ethics.docx`)

**Description:** Written analysis of ethical considerations

**Topics Covered:**
- Identification of biases
- Equity in program design
- Environmental impact assessment
- Recommendations for improvement

### 4. Assignment Guidelines (`BAIT 507 HW 2 2024.docx`)

**Description:** Detailed assignment requirements and deliverables

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To replicate the analysis:

### Prerequisites

- **Database System:** Oracle SQL Developer, MySQL Workbench, or PostgreSQL
- **SQL Client:** Any SQL-compatible client
- **Optional:** Microsoft Word for viewing ethics analysis

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pmehta98/BAIT507-CCI-Analysis.git
   cd BAIT507-CCI-Analysis
   ```

2. **Initialize the Database:**
   - Open your SQL client
   - Connect to your database instance
   - Run `CCI_DDL.sql` to create tables and insert data
   ```sql
   @CCI_DDL.sql
   ```

3. **Execute Queries:**
   - Open `Queries.sql` in your SQL environment
   - Run queries individually or as a script
   - Review results and analysis

4. **Review Ethics Analysis:**
   - Open `Data Ethics.docx` to read the ethical considerations

---

## üìñ Usage

### Running SQL Queries

```sql
-- Example: Check user participation trends
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    COUNT(p.activity_id) as activity_count
FROM CCIUSER u
LEFT JOIN PARTICIPATION p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id
ORDER BY activity_count DESC;
```

### Analyzing Results

1. Execute each query in `Queries.sql`
2. Document the output
3. Cross-reference with ethics analysis
4. Draw insights about program effectiveness
