# Consumer Carbon Incentives (CCI) Program Analysis

This project analyzes Consumer Carbon Incentive (CCI) programs using SQL-based techniques. The focus is on understanding user behavior, reward redemption patterns, and program efficiency. By examining participation trends and potential biases, the analysis supports actionable insights aligned with the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and Goal 13 (Climate Action).

## Objectives
- Analyze user participation trends in low-carbon activities.
- Identify inefficiencies and potential biases in reward allocation.
- Provide recommendations to enhance program sustainability and effectiveness.

## Key Components
- **SQL Scripts**:
  - `queries.sql`: Contains SQL queries for extracting insights, such as participation analysis, credit balances, and activity rankings.
  - `ddl_and_inserts.sql`: Includes database schema creation and data population scripts.
- **Documentation**:
  - Assignment instructions and data ethics discussions are stored in the `docs/` folder.
- **Outputs**:
  - Results from SQL queries and analysis are saved in the `outputs/` folder.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Core language for database queries and data analysis.
- **Relational Database**: Structured storage and retrieval of project data.
- **Microsoft Word**: Used for documenting instructions and results.

## How to Use
1. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Run the `sql/ddl_and_inserts.sql` script to create database tables and populate them with sample data.
2. **Run SQL Queries**:
   - Execute the SQL queries in `sql/queries.sql` to generate insights and analyze program data.
3. **Review Outputs**:
   - View the results of the analysis in the `outputs/` folder.

## Results
This analysis highlights key trends in user participation, identifies inefficiencies in the reward program, and provides actionable recommendations to optimize its impact on sustainability.
