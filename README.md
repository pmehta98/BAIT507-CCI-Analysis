# BAIT 507 Homework Assignment 2: Data Ethics and SQL Queries

## Project Overview

This repository contains the work for **BAIT 507 Homework Assignment 2**, focusing on **data ethics and SQL query analysis** in the context of Consumer Carbon Incentives (CCI) programs. The project is guided by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goals **12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)** and **13 (Climate Action)**.

The database explored in this assignment holds records about CCI programs, simulating real-world data on consumer behavior and rewards for low-carbon choices.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Explore **data ethics** issues, such as biases and unintended consequences in reward systems.
2. Analyze **database records** using SQL to generate insights related to:
   - Consumer behaviors
   - Environmental sustainability
3. Provide recommendations for improving CCI programs based on the findings.

## Features

- **Data Ethics Analysis:**
  - Address questions about biases in the CCI program (e.g., age, economic status, geography).
  - Examine potential increases in carbon emissions due to certain rewards.

- **SQL Query Solutions:**
  - Identify trends in user participation.
  - Calculate user credit balances.
  - Rank activities by their popularity.

## Key Files

1. **`CCI_DDL.sql`**:
   - Contains the database schema and initial data insertion for tables like `ACTIVITY`, `CARBONREWARD`, `CCIUSER`, etc.
2. **`Queries.sql`**:
   - SQL scripts solving the assigned queries.
3. **`Data Ethics.docx`**:
   - Answers to the data ethics questions with supporting query outputs.
4. **`BAIT 507 HW 2 2024.docx`**:

## Setup Instructions

To replicate the analysis:
1. **Database Initialization:**
   - Use the script in `CCI_DDL.txt` to create and populate the database tables.
2. **SQL Queries:**
   - Run the queries provided in `Queries.sql` using your preferred SQL environment (e.g., Oracle SQL Developer, MySQL Workbench).
3. **Ethics Analysis:**
   - Refer to `Data Ethics.docx` for detailed explanations.
